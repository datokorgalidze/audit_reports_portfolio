# Audit Reports Portfolio
## Overview
Welcome to my Audit Reports Portfolio! This repository contains comprehensive smart contract audit reports that I have conducted to assess security vulnerabilities, best practices, and gas optimizations in blockchain applications.

Each report includes:

- Security Findings (High, Medium, Low severity issues)
- Gas Optimizations
- Code Best Practices
- Risk Classification
## Why These Audits Matter?
Smart contract security is critical in DeFi, NFTs, and blockchain applications. These audits help projects identify vulnerabilities before deployment, ensuring secure and efficient contract execution.
